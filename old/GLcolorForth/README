 GLcolorForth README
--------------------

* colorForth *

colorForth is the language/operating system designed and used by
Chuck Moore. The system is stand-alone, booting from a floppy disk and
interfacing PC hardware directly. More information on the system can be
found at:

   www.colorforth.com

* GLcolorForth *

GLcolorForth is a port of colorForth to the Linux operating system,
using both X windows and OpenGL libraries. This is an update to
XcolorForth which ran quite slowly on some X servers. If you have
hardware accelerated OpenGL, GLcolorForth may be preferable to
XcolorForth. Of course to get the full experience run the original
colorForth.

* Compile *

  ./compile

* Run *

  ./glcf

* Differences between colorForth and GLcolorForth. *

  Boot

  colorForth boots from the boot sector on a floppy and copies the
  first 9 sectors from the floppy disk. GLcolorForth loads the file
  "color.com" to the bss section of the 'glcf' program and jumps to the
  start of the bss section. 

  Memory

  colorForth uses a 32-bit flat mode and assumes 32 megabytes of
  memory, the start of the colorForth is a address 0. GLcolorForth uses
  Linux's virtual memory system and assumes 4 megabytes of memory. The
  start address is fixed but non-zero

  start

  The word 'start' gives the byte address of the start of the
  image. The work block will add start/4 to get the word address of a
  block.
  
  Graphics

  colorForth draws graphics into a buffer, which is copied in whole
  directly to frame buffer of the graphics card. GLcolorForth opens a
  GL rendering context and uses the OpenGL API to draw colorForth
  primitives. A consequence is that the drawing buffer is no longer
  accessible, some programs will not work in GLcolorForth.

  Keyboard

  colorForth reads directly from the keyboard port to poll for key
  events. GLcolorForth fetches keyboard events from the X event queue.

  save

  'save' in colorForth saves the colorForth image onto the floppy
  disk. The GLcolorForth 'save' saves the colorForth image to the file
  "color.com".

  boot

  'boot' exits GLcolorForth

* bput and bget *

  The bash scripts bput and bget are provided so you can copy blocks
  to and from the colorForth image.
