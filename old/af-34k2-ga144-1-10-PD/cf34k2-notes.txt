3.4k2 made from 3.4k1.
GA144, 7k cores and padring.
=================================================
INSTALLING AND RUNNING THIS VERSION:

colorForth kernel 4.0e8b is NECESSARY so that
there is RAM enough for huge 144 tables.
=================================================

New words in kernel dictionary:


Windows only:


===================================================

Description of changes:

Added John's latest html generator.

Added Charley's latest softsim.

Made various cleanups for publication.

- Made universal semantic change in g18 compiler:
  p, is now pattern,  ,  is now number.

===================================================

To-do:

ROM 100 as 1wire boot node.

1. SIDE ANALOG NODES should have their IOCS bit assignments reviewed.  Currently, they show up port read/write status in left/right configuration.

2. All power connectors COULD deliver power on higher metals (made sure no channel interferences exist).

3. Fills, if necessary.

4. Probably a more definitive "PIN 1" indicator.

Manual or auto edge cap generation

Enlarge internal caps

Auto via generation along edges periphery and inside

Automate wbl, wbr lengths for last pads.

Simplify analog power bus break.

Doublecheck configuration and wiring of all I/O nodes.

TESTBED code is directly checking cuco value to make
decisions that should be made on the basis of bedtab

Padring bus continuity is using just pdx, assumes symmetry

Autogenerate more metal 3 and 4 on node rings when feasible

Make sure wake5 and wake3 generate correct logic for nodes 7 and 9.

OkadWork colorForth source changes:

--------------------------------------

*18 - Version.  Add  html  to load the HTML utility.  Add arrayforth comment before loading 144.  Move public domain range comment down to bottom of block.  Format top of block so only one line shifts when version is changed.

68 - Add  ?seeb  to test whether seeb is set.

**110 - Update for actual word count in boot frames.  exec still good at b6.  Boot node 300 not 17.  IDE still not made to work for USB.

**112 - Begin tweaking routes for GA144.  Needs more work.

116 - Maintain sport as needed.  Enlarge sdat from 16384 to 24576; 16k is just too small for 144 nodes!

118 - Adjust /frame for actual word count.  Boot node is 708 not 33.  exec still good at 0ae.  Identify as node 708 in comments.

120 - Temp kludge up GA144 routes for async node.  Extend to 140 for full path 2.

122 - Divide by 100, not 10, in  wall .

126 - Change node slots 6 and 7 to 16 and 17 for end and wire node components.

136 - Adopt GA4 change to stay within legit RAM addrs in memory test.

140 - Extend defn of path 2.

148 - Add zeroing of orgn so that one time IDE ops possible.

150 - GB Update ending block number of last obliterate from 1254 to 1248 since Charley has used blocks in that range.

176..188 - updated entire HTML listing generator.
 
942  - CS changed some load blocks and added comments. Added the address
to the boots statements. See block 1298.

1052 - GB correct g18 nomenclature.

1192 - GB correct g18 nomenclature.

1248 - CS translated some of Steven's smtm code into arrayforth in order
to test softsim. It's a good example for new users to see as well.

1250 - CS Was blank. Added the work .all to show a miniature
representation of the 8x18 array with the visible 4x8 window
highlighted. Added a commented out alternate version of .all used for
debugging the port handshakes. Leaving it because it will be handy in
the future.

1252 - CS Added a load screen for making 'softsim.html' as
documentation.

1258 - CS replaced bus! with port !, changed the logic leading up to
that, and changed the formatting. The write request for the up port is
cleared on each step when time <> baud.

1260 - CS removed /bus and /buses, no longer needed.

1262 - CS completely replaced @comm, !comm, @inst code from blocks 1262
and 1264 with simpler code here.

1264 - CS moved 1266 back to here to fill in reclaimed space.

1266 - CS moved 1268 back to here to fill in reclaimed space.  Use names
right, down, etc. in place of 175, 145, etc. Change bus to merge pend
and dest into port, preparing for further changes to @comm, !comm, and
@inst (see block 1262).

1268 - CS blank, not used anymore.

1272 - CS factored out port and defined pend and dest in terms of it.

1274 - CS shadows.

1278 - CS simplified wake? to depend only on the node variable slp.
Changed to lighter shade of blue for better visibility. In me? changed
to lighter shade of gray also for better visibility. Simplified ?red and
let it become silver when sleeping.

1282 - CS added rqs. to monitor the read/write request bits in com.

1284 - CS inserted rqs. into com. Changed color for rr. to red, so now
the R register is always red, no matter what part of the display.

1294 - CS added variable wind? and words .wind and wtog to optionally
show the 4x8 inside 8x18 window or an extra focus node.

1296 - CS inserted wtog into keyboard handler array. Added a w prompt
too. This toggles between a display with one focus node + window and two
focus nodes without the window.

1298 - CS extended /dest to also zero each port and pend (redundant?).
rese now inits es to -1 as part of a commented out debugging display
(see block 1250). Changed boots so that the address is specified as well
as the node. Now you can magically boot to address 0, or whatever.

1300 - Fix async IDE boot to compile to 708 instead of 703 (sheesh!) and exit before loading the test code.  STILL NEED TO GET IDE BITS OUT OF HARDSIM AREA.  CS added '(smtm test) 0 node 1248 load exit' to give first time users of softsim something to see right away (smtm test).

1400 - Rename  ,  as  p,  and use it in  s4 .

1406 - Add entry point  ,  in defn of  lit .  Make it refer to  p,

1408 - CS Add -, to comma as number to target memory.  CS/GB Add new opcode spellings  @p !p ex .  GB Remove -,
