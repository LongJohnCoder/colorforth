NOTE:  If you find your source blocks are shifted down (i.e. block "18"
begins with "Edit character application"), then go to boot.asm, and
follow the instructions after the label 'cold' (line 110) to fix it.


This version reverts to Chuck's original floppy load code (at label cold
in boot.asm).  All reports I have so far indicate that this is the one
that works, although I don't understand why -- it seems to SKIP the
second sector.

Also it fixes some corruption in block 34 and in the icons (capital 'F'
and 'W').  I think that's about it.


color16 is the whole 72K for 16-bit color (mode 4117h)
color32 runs in the original 32-bit color (mode 4118h)

I haven't modified the color words in block 30 for the 16-bit color one,
so the logo will have the wrong colors.


I *think* we have fixed all the corruption and whatnot in this version,
so I'm now going to return to pretending colorforth doesn't exist. :P

Happy colorforthing!
